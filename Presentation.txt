This work was done during the research internship of the second year at MinesParisTech by Valentin ANJOU at the IBENS, 
under the supervision of Silvia DE MONTE, Francesco D'OVIDIO and Chris BOWLER at the IBENS (Institut de Biologie de l'Ecole Normale Supérieure). 

The goal was to concentrate the data of various sources and to analyse the slopes of the rank-abundance distribution to try to find a correlation between those elements through the data of the TaraOcean's expedition.
